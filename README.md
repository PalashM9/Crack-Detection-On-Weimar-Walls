# Automated Crack Detection in German Walls

## Overview
This repository contains a Python-based machine learning project for detecting cracks in structural walls. The project employs image processing techniques and deep learning algorithms to identify potential safety concerns in buildings, inspired by the necessity for improved structural inspections.

## Features
- Image annotation using CVAT tool.
- Data augmentation techniques for model robustness.
- Python scripts for dataset preparation and model training.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/Keras
- CVAT for image annotations

## Usage
1. Annotate images using CVAT.
2. Prepare the dataset by running `dataset_preparation.py`.
3. Train the model with augmented data using `train_model.py`.
4. Evaluate the model performance using `evaluate_model.py`.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the project are welcome. Please submit a pull request or create an issue for any bugs or feature suggestions.
